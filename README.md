# Training-TR-101 Report
## Why Programming?
In today's digital world everyone uses computer and mobile phone.It is essential to know how to use the apps/programs on such a digital devices and also the logic behind it works.Thus knowing how to program will helps you to understand and tinker with world. Various Scenarios were used in airport to discuss the concepts of programming.  
## What is Programming?
Instructions are provided to computer to accomplish specific tasks.Such instructions are known as program and act of creating a program is called programming.  


**5 Minute Quiz**  
**Aspects of solving a problem- Input,Processing,Output**
## Algorithm,pseudo-code and flowchart
Algorithm should be represented from the mental thoughts into a form which others can understand.There are primarily two ways of representing the algorithm:


Flowchart: Diagrammatic way of representing the algorithm.  
Pseudo-code:Representing the algorithm between a program and normal english.  
## Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine one or more relational expressions.  
|Operators|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|AND|Result will be true, if both the expressions are true.If anyone or both are false,the result will be false|
|OR|Result will be true,even if one of the expression is true.If both the expressions are false,the result will be false.|
|NOT|If the expression is true,result will be false and vice versa|

## Datatypes  
Python Programming language supports the following datatypes:   

1. int
2. float
3. string
4. boolean
5. long

## Variables  
A variable is a name that is assigned to a value.It is done so that we can refer to that value at some later point in the program.Variables has six dimensions- name,datatype,address,value,scope,lifetime.  

## Dynamic and Static Typing
Python is a dynamically typed whereas C is statically typed.  
Dynamic Typing is a technique in some languages where depending on how a value is used,the data type of the variable is dynamically and automatically assigned.  
Static Typing is used in some languages where the datatype has to be declared before a variable is used.  
## Precedence of Operators  
Precedence of an operator can be identified based on the rule- BODMAS.Brackets followed by Orders(Powers,Roots),followed by Addition and Subtraction.

## Coding Standards  
Coding standars are the set of guildlines that can be used to enhance the readability and clarity of the program and make it easy to debug and maintain the program.
